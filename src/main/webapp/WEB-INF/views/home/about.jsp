 <h1>About YouMeBID <br>(based on YouApp)</h1>
	The YouApp is a friend-finder for people with chronic health conditions. 
	It is being built first for IBD, but should be useful for people with any condition. 
	Our research suggests that ‘Crohnies’ on Facebook post to discussion boards but do not necessarily friend others who also post in these threads.
	Our theory is that being part of a network of similar peers is helpful (both in terms of having people to support you and having people to ask questions of) and that a more connected community might be one that can self-organize more effectively to participate in the distributed learning health care system.
